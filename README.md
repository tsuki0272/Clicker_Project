# Overview

Clicker Clicker is an implementation of a twist on a Clicker game (also “idle” or “incremental games”) for COMP 2452 in
Winter 2026. Clicker Clicker has the user click on a Clicker (also known as a cursor), and offers some additional features:

* Total clicks are incremented every time the large Clicker is clicked
* Click power can be increased by purchasing upgrades from the Upgrades section
* There are 2 types of upgrades:
  * Additive Upgrades: These increase click power by a fixed amount
  * Multiplicative Upgrades: These increase your click power by a multiplicative factor
* The goal is to get as many clicks as possible!
